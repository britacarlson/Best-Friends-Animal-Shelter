## Demo

Accessing our website:

1. To access our website, the file titled "index.html" will display our website's contents.
2. Styles.css is our styling sheet used throughout the entire website.
- It is broken down in commented sections letting you know what styles belongs to which section.
3. On the navigation bar, click on the respective tabs to see what each tab is about.

Accessing our Firebase database:

1. Once you have inputted the values into the boxes, navigate over to the Google firebase database.
2. To get started, click the "Get Started" button in the middle of the screen.
3. Navigate over to the main overview page that allows you to see the three apps we have designed.
- They are called "Signup Info", "Contacted Info", and "Campaign Info".
4. The title of the respective apps represent the three firebase instances we used to connect our website to the back-end database.
5. Simply enter the information from the signup.html page, contact.html page, and support our campaign.html page
6. Once the information has been inputted, on the left hand side, hit on "Realtime Database" and you are prompted with our back-end data.
7. Click on the arrow on the left hand side once you have entered in the information in our website.
8. The information should display showing that the connection between our webiste and database has been successful.
9. You can repeat these steps for the two other pages to ensure that our database is linked.
